This is because not all sub types will have the same entries in their profile - for example: Artist Type 2 only records music, so won't need the GigAbility stuff; an Artist Type 3 only Gigs, so will not need to upload their music; an Artist Type 1 that records music and does live gigs will need both entry sets for GigAbility and Music Uploads; an Artist Type 4, 5, 6, 7 will need GigAbility (but only able to be booked for collabs by other Artists, not for Gigs invites from Venues) AND no music uploads EXCEPT for sample recordings (Sample Vocals from a Vocalist; Sample Drums etc. for an Instrumentalist, etc.) which help them sell themselves to Artists looking to hire them WITHOUT their uploads being available to Stream/Download/Charts.

And yes. I know I said in-short. 😉

No need to call. Just read this message in conjunction with the *‘Artist’ Types, Sub Types, Identifiers*, *‘Venue’ Types, Sub Types, Identifiers*, etc. in Notion, and *User Signup Journey/Profile Structure* spreadsheet, and you'll be fine. Here if you need any clarity.
