Default Royalty Splits
Royalties are paid directly to Rights Holders. Now you can set the default Royalty Splits.
Ignore other Rights Holders here - this is purely for the Artist-share of Royalties, and how that is divided among Artist Members (and your Artist Support Team, if they get a share).

Think of Default Royalty Splits like this:
When you Gig, or release a Track, which members of your Artist team get paid, and what share?

ℹ️ Royalty Splits can be adjusted on an individual track level from your Control Panel later.
ℹ️ Individual Members will be paid their share of Royalties directly via Gigrilla.
ℹ️ All Royalties owed to the Artist’s members must add-up to 100%.

ℹ️ Tracks you upload must be your own original works, or officially licensed covers.
ℹ️ Album Collaborator information will be based on the individual Tracks you upload.
ℹ️ Royalties for Rights Holders will be based on Default Artist Splits unless edited at individual Track-level; while all other Rights Holders are assigned to each individual Track you upload.
ℹ️ To avoid Tracks being permanently excluded from Album Chart stats, when you set any individual Track with a scheduled Track Release Date (TRD), the Album Release Date (ARD) will be auto-set to the day after the latest individual TRD. (You can override this ARD if you are happy for tracks released after your chosen ARD to be permanently excluded from future Album stats.)
ℹ️ If your Album Release Date occurs before all Album Tracks are officially registered in your chosen territories, your Album Release Date will be pushed back by the system until registered.
