**or
> Option Two - Paid Regional Sales Partner Model - this would involve a single regional shop available to each region on Gigrilla, with multiple brands & products on sale from that one retail-supplier, which Gigrilla can sell to one operator per region then take commission for all sales generated through Gigrilla** (*and then in the future, Gigrilla could replace all of these regional retail-suppliers with a single, international solution, becoming its own distributor & drop-shipper for other brands, while also selling its own Gigrilla-branded products available through a single Gigrilla shop*)**.**
