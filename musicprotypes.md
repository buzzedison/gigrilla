*‚ÑπÔ∏è* These are professionals from across the music industry, involved in the creation, production, promotion, protection & enjoyment of live and recorded music. They may be employed by a Music Service, Record Label, Distributor, or Music Publisher, or they might work independently as self-employed, independent or freelance music industry professionals.

**üîî** You can **subscribe for free** to any individual Music Pro. This allows you to **view** and **like** their posts and see them in your **feed**, putting you in control of the content you‚Äôre interested in seeing.

üíé ****You can also **upgrade** to a **premium subscription** for ¬£1/month which enables **direct private messaging** to **all** Music Pros, plus the ability to **comment publicly** on **any** Music Pro‚Äôs posts.

### **This user type moves Gigrilla a step away from Facebook and a step towards LinkedIn, blending something Spotify and other streaming platforms can‚Äôt; a true music community.**

**Music Pro Premium Subscription Upgrade explained ‚â° ¬£1/m || ‚â° $1/m ‚â°** (localised)
***This can be sold to ‚ÄòMusic Pro Types‚Äô plus all other User Types across the website.** There are some free capabilities to interact with Music Pros on a basic level, plus we‚Äôre then providing a service similar to LinkedIn Premium to allow people to unlock wider communication capabilities; and with this paywall we are (1) limiting unwarranted spam and troll comms by putting them behind a paywall, and (2) creating another revenue stream to cover our operational costs.*

THESE MUSIC PROS ARE **INDIVIDUALS**, *REGARDLESS OF WHETHER* THEY WORK FOR A ‚ÄòMUSIC SERVICE TYPE‚Äô COMPANY/ORGANISATION *OR WHETHER* THEY ARE SELF-EMPLOYED/FREELANCERS:

**This is essentially a Sub-Type of a Fan, but with more toys; searchable; special permissions; special restrictions; and verifications are required - these Music Pro accounts have a public profile page where they can share their thoughts, opinions, experiences and advice as thought leaders within the music industry. Their content will in a Fan‚Äôs feed if they Fan subscribes to them; similarly, other Music Pros will see content from Music Pros that they subscribe to in their own Fan feeds.**

**Music Pros can choose to be multiple Sub-Types of a Music Pro Main Category; A Music Pro‚Äôs Posts are searchable by Main Category and Sub Category; When Music Pros Post, they can tag their Post with the relevant Sub-Types so their Post is categorised and searchable under those Sub Categories, while also being visible under Main Categories regardless of Sub Categories tagged.**

THESE MUSIC PROS ARE **INDIVIDUALS**, *REGARDLESS OF WHETHER* THEY WORK FOR A ‚ÄòMUSIC SERVICE TYPE‚Äô COMPANY/ORGANISATION *OR WHETHER* THEY ARE SELF-EMPLOYED/FREELANCERS.

**Booking System Notes:**

IF THEY DON‚ÄôT HAVE AN ASSOCIATION WITH AN EXISTING ‚ÄòMUSIC SERVICE TYPE‚Äô COMPANY/ORGANISATION PAGE (-AS AN ADMIN FOR A PAGE, OWNER OF A PAGE, ETC.) THEY CAN BE BOOKED DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR MUSIC PRO ACCOUNT; HOWEVER, IF THEY DO HAVE AN ASSOCIATION WITH A ‚ÄòMUSIC SERVICE TYPE‚Äô PAGE, THEIR BOOKING LINK ON THEIR MUSIC PRO ACCOUNT LINKS TO THEIR COMPANY/ORGANISATION PAGE (SO OTHERS CAN VIEW/MANAGE THESE BOOKINGS, PLUS THE BOOKING SYSTEMS - THINKING AVAILABILITY & SCHEDULING THROUGH GIGRILLA - DOESN‚ÄôT HAVE CONFLICTS WITH OTHER BOOKINGS THROUGH THE PAGE).

IF AN EMPLOYEE LEAVES A COMPANY/ORGANISATION IT WON‚ÄôT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE ‚ÄòMUSIC SERVICE TYPE‚Äô PAGE AS THEY RETAIN THE BOOKING AND CONTROL OVER THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THEIR CUSTOMER/CLIENT.

FURTHERMORE, IF AN EMPLOYEE LEAVES A COMPANY/ORGANISATION, THEY EFFECTIVELY BECOME SELF-EMPLOYED/FREELANCER, WITH THEIR OWN UNASSOCIATED BOOKING SYSTEM.

SIMILARLY, IF A SELF-EMPLOYED/FREELANCER BECOMES ASSOCIATED WITH A ‚ÄòMUSIC SERVICE TYPE‚Äô COMPANY/ORGANISATIONPAGE (BECOMES EMPLOYED/SETS UP THEIR OWN), THEN THEIR BOOKING SYSTEM SWITCHES TO BECOME CONTROLED BY THE PAGE.
