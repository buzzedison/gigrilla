Artist Music

Upload/Manage Your Music

DevNote: Permanent Message:
💎 Together, we are making the Music Industry fairer by ensuring everyone involved gets paid properly - and where laws allow, paying 100% of Royalties.

⚠️ It is crucial that you enter/confirm all data and ID codes correctly, to ensure all Rights Holders get paid their fair share. Beside fairness, having proper identification codes is a sign of professionalism in the Music Industry.

🚨 You are legally and financially responsible for any music you upload, regardless of territory - so please pay attention to all of the tips and details.

📊 While some metadata is sent to us by 3rd Parties, we ask you to check and add more layers of data to make sure your music gets heard and pays properly.



Upload Guide for Pre-Registered Music:
 Show / Hide Upload Guide below (must tick confirmation underneath)

[_] I confirm that I have read and understood the Upload Guide below.

 DevNote: Tips below are auto-shown, but can be hidden. (Rocker / Toggle Switch?)
 DevNote: For the "Show / Hide..." rocker/toggle switch for the Upload Guide:-
- Only works if the end user has ticked the "I confirm..." box underneath it first.
- Once hidden, stays hidden on subsequent visits; can be toggled both ways.
- Once ticked, tick confirmation is permanently ticked (not needed each time it is shown/hidden).
- Each Admin for the Artist goes through this same process, independently of other Artist Admins (so one tick doesn't apply to all admins).



ℹ️ You CANNOT upload unregistered music of any kind - please register your music first (see below for appropriate registration organisations).

ℹ️ Tracks must be your own Original Works & Sound Recordings, or officially Licensed Covers, or officially Authorised Remixes, or using officially Authorised Samples. You are legally and financially responsible and liable for all music you upload, regardless of territory.

ℹ️ Remember to tick “💾[✅] Apply This (DATA) to All Tracks in This Release” as you complete the Track 1 form, to pre-populate other Track form data, unless each Track in your Specific Release has different data.

ℹ️ Audio Filenames must be = “Artist Name - Track Title.wav” and Tracks must be:
✓  WAV/AIFF 16–24‑bit, 44.1–96 kHz. No clipping or dithering artifacts.
✓  Loudness Tip: Aim −14 LUFS integrated; avoid limiter pumping. We won’t alter your master.
✓  Stereo required (mono not accepted).
✓ True Peak must be < -1 dBTP (to prevent clipping on streaming platforms).
✓ No silence >2 seconds at start/end of Audio.
✓ Maximum file size: 2GB.
✓ Minimum duration: 30 Seconds; Maximum duration: 60 Minutes.

ℹ️ Lyrics must be full and cleanly formatted for each Track, remembering to match lyric version to Track version for radio edits/child-safe Tracks.

ℹ️ For each individual Track, you’ll need all relevant ISNI, IPI/CAE, ISRC, & ISWC codes. You’ll also need a GTIN (UPC/EAN) for each Specific Release. This will help you to get paid properly. Click the ‘Get’ or ‘Find’ links below for help getting or finding these details before you upload your music:

 Get / Find an ISNI = International Standard Name Identifier (for Creators).
ℹ️ Each Artist Member and the Artist Entity can have individual ISNIs. Your unique digital ID prevents name confusion (such as Artists with the same name), ensures correct crediting, Tracks all your work (songs, recordings) across platforms, and guarantees you get paid accurately by linking your various identities (Stage names, pseudonyms) to you, like a digital passport for your creative output.

 Get / Find an IPI/CAE = Interested Parties Number (Composer, Author, Publisher)
ℹ️ This is for Songwriters, Lyricists, Composers, and Music Publishers - An IPI/CAE number is automatically issued when joining a Performance Rights Organisation (PRO) like ASCAP, BMI, or PRS as a writer/composer; it's a unique ID for Tracking royalties (assigned by CISAC) and you can find it in your PRO account. You need this number for accurate song registration and to ensure you get paid for your work.

 Get / Find an ISRC = International Standard Recording Code (for Sound Recording).
ℹ️ This is for the Sound Recording. Each unique recording (e.g., Original Studio / Acoustic / Radio Edit / Remastered / Remix / Instrumental / Live version) must have its own unique ISRC. ISRCs are permanent once assigned and should never be reused for another recording, even if the original recording is deleted or the rights change hands.

 Get / Find an ISWC = International Standard Musical Work Code (for Musical Work).
ℹ️ ISWCs identify the underlying composition, whereas an ISRC references a specific recording of a composition. A song/score can only have one ISWC attached to it, but it can have multiple ISRCs. This ensures the original composers/songwriters get paid.

 Get / Find a GTIN = Global Trade Item Number (for this Specific Release): Either a UPC (12 Digit Universal Product Code) or an EAN (13 Digit European/International Article Number) - you only need one type of GTIN, not both.
ℹ️ This is for the Specic Release of a single or collection of Tracks. This helps you get paid properly, enables Official Chart entries, aids in securing sync licensing opportunities (music for Film, TV, and Ads) and other business deals.

 DevNote: everything above is auto-shown, but can be hidden with the Show/Hide button above.

Artist Music

Upload/Manage Your Music

DevNote: Permanent Message:
💎 Together, we are making the Music Industry fairer by ensuring everyone involved gets paid properly - and where laws allow, paying 100% of Royalties.

⚠️ It is crucial that you enter/confirm all data and ID codes correctly, to ensure all Rights Holders get paid their fair share. Beside fairness, having proper identification codes is a sign of professionalism in the Music Industry.

🚨 You are legally and financially responsible for any music you upload, regardless of territory - so please pay attention to all of the tips and details.

📊 While some metadata is sent to us by 3rd Parties, we ask you to check and add more layers of data to make sure your music gets heard and pays properly.



Upload Guide for Pre-Registered Music:
 Show / Hide Upload Guide below (must tick confirmation underneath)

[_] I confirm that I have read and understood the Upload Guide below.

 DevNote: Tips below are auto-shown, but can be hidden. (Rocker / Toggle Switch?)
 DevNote: For the "Show / Hide..." rocker/toggle switch for the Upload Guide:-
- Only works if the end user has ticked the "I confirm..." box underneath it first.
- Once hidden, stays hidden on subsequent visits; can be toggled both ways.
- Once ticked, tick confirmation is permanently ticked (not needed each time it is shown/hidden).
- Each Admin for the Artist goes through this same process, independently of other Artist Admins (so one tick doesn't apply to all admins).



ℹ️ You CANNOT upload unregistered music of any kind - please register your music first (see below for appropriate registration organisations).

ℹ️ Tracks must be your own Original Works & Sound Recordings, or officially Licensed Covers, or officially Authorised Remixes, or using officially Authorised Samples. You are legally and financially responsible and liable for all music you upload, regardless of territory.

ℹ️ Remember to tick “💾[✅] Apply This (DATA) to All Tracks in This Release” as you complete the Track 1 form, to pre-populate other Track form data, unless each Track in your Specific Release has different data.

ℹ️ Audio Filenames must be = “Artist Name - Track Title.wav” and Tracks must be:
✓  WAV/AIFF 16–24‑bit, 44.1–96 kHz. No clipping or dithering artifacts.
✓  Loudness Tip: Aim −14 LUFS integrated; avoid limiter pumping. We won’t alter your master.
✓  Stereo required (mono not accepted).
✓ True Peak must be < -1 dBTP (to prevent clipping on streaming platforms).
✓ No silence >2 seconds at start/end of Audio.
✓ Maximum file size: 2GB.
✓ Minimum duration: 30 Seconds; Maximum duration: 60 Minutes.

ℹ️ Lyrics must be full and cleanly formatted for each Track, remembering to match lyric version to Track version for radio edits/child-safe Tracks.

ℹ️ For each individual Track, you’ll need all relevant ISNI, IPI/CAE, ISRC, & ISWC codes. You’ll also need a GTIN (UPC/EAN) for each Specific Release. This will help you to get paid properly. Click the ‘Get’ or ‘Find’ links below for help getting or finding these details before you upload your music:

 Get / Find an ISNI = International Standard Name Identifier (for Creators).
ℹ️ Each Artist Member and the Artist Entity can have individual ISNIs. Your unique digital ID prevents name confusion (such as Artists with the same name), ensures correct crediting, Tracks all your work (songs, recordings) across platforms, and guarantees you get paid accurately by linking your various identities (Stage names, pseudonyms) to you, like a digital passport for your creative output.

 Get / Find an IPI/CAE = Interested Parties Number (Composer, Author, Publisher)
ℹ️ This is for Songwriters, Lyricists, Composers, and Music Publishers - An IPI/CAE number is automatically issued when joining a Performance Rights Organisation (PRO) like ASCAP, BMI, or PRS as a writer/composer; it's a unique ID for Tracking royalties (assigned by CISAC) and you can find it in your PRO account. You need this number for accurate song registration and to ensure you get paid for your work.

 Get / Find an ISRC = International Standard Recording Code (for Sound Recording).
ℹ️ This is for the Sound Recording. Each unique recording (e.g., Original Studio / Acoustic / Radio Edit / Remastered / Remix / Instrumental / Live version) must have its own unique ISRC. ISRCs are permanent once assigned and should never be reused for another recording, even if the original recording is deleted or the rights change hands.

 Get / Find an ISWC = International Standard Musical Work Code (for Musical Work).
ℹ️ ISWCs identify the underlying composition, whereas an ISRC references a specific recording of a composition. A song/score can only have one ISWC attached to it, but it can have multiple ISRCs. This ensures the original composers/songwriters get paid.

 Get / Find a GTIN = Global Trade Item Number (for this Specific Release): Either a UPC (12 Digit Universal Product Code) or an EAN (13 Digit European/International Article Number) - you only need one type of GTIN, not both.
ℹ️ This is for the Specic Release of a single or collection of Tracks. This helps you get paid properly, enables Official Chart entries, aids in securing sync licensing opportunities (music for Film, TV, and Ads) and other business deals.

 DevNote: everything above is auto-shown, but can be hidden with the Show/Hide button above.
