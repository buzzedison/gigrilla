# DDEX compliance plan (mapped to sprints)

## Sprint 1 — “First Revenue+” → Minimum DDEX

**Outcome this sprint:** accept creator uploads with clean identifiers, and emit **DSR** (Sales & Usage) files for paid downloads.

**Do now**

1. **Identifiers & roles (data model)**
    - Store: **ISRC** (per track), **UPC/GTIN** (per release/album), optional **ISWC** (work), **ISNI**/**IPI** for people, and our own Party IDs + space for external **DPID** later. Follow DDEX identifier rules/formatting (no display dashes; preserve leading zeros; capture namespaces for proprietary IDs). ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/best-practices-for-all-ddex-standards/guidance-on-identifiers%2C-iso-codes-lists-and-dates/communication-of-identifiers-in-ddex-messages/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. **RIN-lite capture in upload**
    - Extend your “Upload + ISRC Gate” form to capture **RIN** core credits (who did what, where, when) so credits map cleanly later; allow importing a RIN file if available. (This is just data capture this sprint; you can export RIN later.) ([DDEX](https://ddex.net/standards/recording-information-notification/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/recording-information-notification-%28rin%29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - This aligns perfectly with your ISRC gate and “Standard Royalties Split/roles” flow.
3. **Emit DSR for downloads**
    - Implement **DDEX DSR (flat-file)** using the **Basic Audio** profile for **download purchases**. Start with header/footer + summary + detail records; one file per rights holder per cycle (daily is fine in dev; monthly in prod). ([DDEX](https://ddex.net/standards/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite-%28dsr%29/dsr-explained/architecture%2C-allowed-value-sets-and-record-type-definitions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DDEX](https://dsr8.ddex.net/digital-sales-report-message-suite%3A-part-8-record-type-definitions/5-record-definitions/5.2-summary-record-types/5.2.1-sy01.03-%E2%80%94-basic-summary-record/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
4. **Housekeeping**
    - Apply for a **DDEX Implementation Licence** (required before go-live). ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/party-identification-and-enrichment-%28pie%29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Assign a stable **Service ID** (string) that goes in every DSR file so partners can reconcile. (Architecture + allowed value sets guide this.) ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite-%28dsr%29/dsr-explained/architecture%2C-allowed-value-sets-and-record-type-definitions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Backlog tweaks (DoD additions)**

- **Upload + ISRC Gate (M):** validate ISO-3901 format; store ISRC, UPC (if part of a release), optional ISWC; collect RIN-lite credits; map user-selected roles to DDEX contributor roles. Blocks publish if any required ID missing. ([DDEX](https://ddex.net/standards/recording-information-notification/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Royalties Split (M):** ensure roles map to DDEX Contributor/Performer roles; persist percent splits for later reporting. ([DDEX](https://ddex.net/standards/recording-information-notification/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Downloads Checkout (M):** on each successful order, create a DSR usage line (download, price, currency, country, ISRC, UPC, timestamps); nightly roll-up emits DSR files. ([DDEX](https://ddex.net/standards/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite-%28dsr%29/dsr-samples/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Payout Accounts + Ledger (Shared):** ledger rows must tie 1:1 to DSR detail rows (file id + line id). ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite-%28dsr%29/dsr-explained/architecture%2C-allowed-value-sets-and-record-type-definitions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**QA you can ship this sprint**

- Validate a sample **Basic Audio DSR** with your first download; verify header/footer counts and that required cells exist (DSR requires fixed cell counts even if empty). ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite-%28dsr%29/dsr-samples/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

---

## Sprint 2 — “Stream & Symmetry+” → Add streaming usage to DSR

**Outcome this sprint:** server-verified plays generate **DSR streaming usage**; search/profile symmetry unaffected.

**Do now**

1. **Play qualification → DSR**
    - For each qualified stream, record a usage line with **use type** (stream), **commercial model** (free/sub/ad-supported), **territory**, **play duration windowing**, **service id**, **ISRC/UPC**. Use the same **Basic Audio** DSR profile for streaming contexts. ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite-%28dsr%29/dsr-explained/architecture%2C-allowed-value-sets-and-record-type-definitions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DDEX](https://dsr1.ddex.net/digital-sales-report-message-suite%253A-part-1-architecture/7-profiles/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. **Fraud & caps**
    - Keep your anti-spam caps (IP/device/time). These also protect DSR integrity (no duplicate claimable events).
3. **Artist→Venue mirror**
    - Not a DDEX thing; no change.

**QA**

- One qualified play → exactly one DSR usage line in the next export; verify totals in **SY01.03** summary. ([DDEX](https://dsr8.ddex.net/digital-sales-report-message-suite%3A-part-8-record-type-definitions/5-record-definitions/5.2-summary-record-types/5.2.1-sy01.03-%E2%80%94-basic-summary-record/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

---

## Sprint 3 — “Tickets & Fan Gigs” → Monthly statements + withdrawals

**Outcome this sprint:** monthly **DSR** exports for downloads + streams; creator statements and payouts reconcile to DSR.

**Do now**

1. **Monthly close**
    - Aggregate ledger → creator statements, and **export monthly DSR** per counterparty. Use DSR samples as fixtures in tests. ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite-%28dsr%29/dsr-samples/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. **Claims hygiene (optional but smart)**
    - Stand up the table scaffolding for **CDM (Claim Detail Message)** so you can handle over/under-claims with publishers later; don’t expose yet. (CDM aligns closely with DSR, easing future rollout.) ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/claim-detail-message-suite-%28cdm%29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

> Note: Ticketing is outside DDEX scope; keep it in your own reporting domain (you can still reflect ticket revenue in creator statements, just not in DSR).
> 

---

## Sprints 4–6 — Scale metadata + label pipelines

**When you’re ready to ingest label/distributor feeds or enrich discovery:**

1. **ERN 4.3 ingest (labels → DSP)**
    - Accept **ERN 4.3** NewReleaseMessage feeds (XML) with web-services or cloud-storage choreography (both defined in 4.3) to load releases/tracks/deals into your catalog. ([DDEX](https://ddex.net/ddex-publishes-ern-4-3-update-and-catalogue-transfer-standard-1-0/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Music Business Association](https://musicbiz.org/news/music-biz-member-ddex-publishes-ern-4-3-update-and-catalogue-transfer-standard-1-0/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/electronic-release-notification-message-suite-%28ern%29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. **MEAD + PIE for richer UX**
    - **MEAD**: pull in “non-core” marketing metadata (images, moods, focus tracks, editorial info) to power Discover/New/Hot and your filters. ([DDEX](https://ddex.net/standards/media-enrichment-and-description/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/about-ddex-standards/ddex-standards/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - **PIE**: manage rich **party** data (bios, aliases, links) without bloating ERN/MEAD; PIE 1.1 focuses on parties and can be delivered alongside ERN. ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/party-identification-and-enrichment-%28pie%29/pie-explained/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DDEX](https://ddex.net/standards/party-identification-and-description/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
3. **DPIDs & partner hygiene**
    - Obtain a **DPID** for Gigrilla; store counterparties’ DPIDs for clean interop (namespaces for proprietary ids). (Also shows up in various regulatory contexts.) ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/best-practices-for-all-ddex-standards/guidance-on-identifiers%2C-iso-codes-lists-and-dates/multiple-proprietary-identification-systems/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/title37/210/37cfr210-31.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
4. **RIN export**
    - If you capture RIN on upload, add the ability to **export RIN** to labels/publishers. ([Rin](https://rin.ddex.net/recording-information-notification/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

---

## Where your current product already lines up

- **ISRC gate, roles/splits, schedule release, moods/genres matching PPL/PRS**—all excellent precursors to clean ERN/RIN/MEAD/DSR mapping. Keep your genre/mood vocabulary aligned with industry lists as you do now.

---

## Engineering checklist (paste into the sprint board)

**Data contracts**

- [ ]  Track: ISRC, Title, Version, Duration, Artists(roles), ReleaseId(UPC), Territories
- [ ]  Release: UPC, GRid(optional), Label, Deals(prices, dates, territories)
- [ ]  Party: internal ID, optional ISNI/IPI, future DPID
- [ ]  Usage event: type (download/stream), timestamp, country (ISO-3166), price/currency (ISO-4217), device, ISRC, ReleaseId, ServiceId

**DSR exporter (Sprint 1)**

- [ ]  Build **Basic Audio** profile export: header/footer + summary + detail
- [ ]  Validate cell counts; fixed delimiters; preserve leading zeros; file naming convention
    
    (Architecture + Record Type definitions). ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite-%28dsr%29/dsr-explained/architecture%2C-allowed-value-sets-and-record-type-definitions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    
- [ ]  Add sample-based unit tests using DDEX **DSR samples**. ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite-%28dsr%29/dsr-samples/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**RIN-lite capture (Sprint 1)**

- [ ]  Capture contributors + roles, studio/date/location; attach to track/release
    
    (compatible with full RIN later). ([DDEX](https://ddex.net/standards/recording-information-notification/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    

**Streaming mapper (Sprint 2)**

- [ ]  One qualified play → one DSR usage line (de-dupe windowed)
    
    (same profile, different use/commercial model). ([DDEX](https://dsr1.ddex.net/digital-sales-report-message-suite%253A-part-1-architecture/7-profiles/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    

**Monthly close (Sprint 3)**

- [ ]  Generate per-counterparty DSR + human-readable statement; totals reconcile to ledger. ([DDEX](https://ddex.net/standards/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

---

## Risks & guardrails

- **Flat-file brittleness:** DSR/CDM require exact cell counts—even empty cells—so avoid exporting from spreadsheets; generate directly from code. ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/best-practices-for-all-ddex-standards/guidance-for-flat-file-issues/dsr-and-cdm-messages-exported-from-spreadsheet-applications/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Vocabulary drift:** keep genres/moods/roles in sync with allowed value sets; otherwise partner ingestion breaks. ([DDEX Knowledge Base](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/digital-sales-reporting-message-suite-%28dsr%29/dsr-explained/architecture%2C-allowed-value-sets-and-record-type-definitions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Scope creep:** ERN/MEAD/PIE are powerful, but you only need **DSR + RIN-lite** to be “DDEX-ready” for your first $$.

# DDEX Implementation Plan for Gigrilla

## Immediate Sprint 1 Additions

### 1. Enhanced Metadata Schema

```sql
-- Add to existing track/release tables
ALTER TABLE tracks ADD COLUMN ddex_metadata JSONB;
ALTER TABLE tracks ADD COLUMN technical_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{
  "sampleRate": null,
  "bitDepth": null,
  "duration": null,
  "lufs": null,
  "peakLevel": null
}';

-- New tables for DDEX compliance
CREATE TABLE ddex_contributors (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  track_id UUID REFERENCES tracks(id),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role_code VARCHAR(50), -- DDEX role codes (MainArtist, Composer, Producer, etc.)
  sequence_number INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE ddex_releases (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  upc_code VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
  catalog_number VARCHAR(50),
  release_type VARCHAR(20), -- Album, Single, EP
  p_line VARCHAR(255), -- Phonographic copyright
  c_line VARCHAR(255), -- Copyright line
  original_release_date DATE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

```

### 2. Upload Flow Enhancements

**Current DoD:** "invalid ISRC rejected; preview plays"
**Enhanced DoD:**

- Invalid ISRC rejected
- All DDEX required fields captured (contributor roles, P&C lines, technical specs)
- Preview plays with correct metadata attached
- UPC generated for releases

### 3. Royalties Split Enhancement

**Current:** "roles & % = 100%; distribution target"
**Enhanced:**

- DDEX-compliant role codes mapped
- Rights territories defined
- Mechanical vs performance rights split
- Publishing splits with ISWC codes (if applicable)

## Sprint 2 Implementation

### 4. DDEX Export Engine (New Shared Rail)

```python
# Core DDEX ERN 4.3 export functionality
class DDEXExporter:
    def generate_ern_message(self, release_id):
        """Generate DDEX ERN 4.3 compliant XML"""
        release = self.get_release_with_metadata(release_id)
        return {
            "MessageHeader": self.build_message_header(),
            "ReleaseList": {
                "Release": {
                    "ReleaseId": [
                        {"UPC": release.upc_code},
                        {"CatalogNumber": release.catalog_number}
                    ],
                    "ReferenceTitle": release.title,
                    "ReleaseResourceReferenceList": self.build_resources(release),
                    "ReleaseDeal": self.build_deal_terms(release)
                }
            },
            "ResourceList": self.build_sound_recordings(release)
        }

    def build_sound_recordings(self, release):
        """Build SoundRecording elements with full metadata"""
        resources = []
        for track in release.tracks:
            resources.append({
                "SoundRecording": {
                    "SoundRecordingId": [{"ISRC": track.isrc}],
                    "ReferenceTitle": track.title,
                    "Duration": track.technical_metadata.get("duration"),
                    "SoundRecordingContributorList": [
                        {
                            "Contributor": {
                                "PartyName": contrib.name,
                                "Role": contrib.role_code,
                                "SequenceNumber": contrib.sequence_number
                            }
                        } for contrib in track.contributors
                    ],
                    "TechnicalSoundRecordingDetails": {
                        "TechnicalResourceDetailsReference": track.id,
                        "AudioCodecType": "FLAC",  # or MP3, AAC based on upload
                        "SamplingRate": track.technical_metadata.get("sampleRate"),
                        "BitsPerSample": track.technical_metadata.get("bitDepth")
                    }
                }
            })
        return resources

```

### 5. Metadata Validation Service

```python
class DDEXValidator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = [
        "title", "isrc", "contributors", "p_line",
        "technical_metadata.duration", "technical_metadata.sampleRate"
    ]

    def validate_for_ddex(self, track_data):
        """Validate track meets DDEX requirements"""
        errors = []

        # Check required fields
        for field in self.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            if not self.get_nested_value(track_data, field):
                errors.append(f"Missing required DDEX field: {field}")

        # Validate ISRC format
        if not self.validate_isrc(track_data.get("isrc")):
            errors.append("Invalid ISRC format")

        # Check contributor roles are DDEX compliant
        for contrib in track_data.get("contributors", []):
            if contrib.get("role_code") not in self.DDEX_ROLE_CODES:
                errors.append(f"Invalid DDEX role code: {contrib.get('role_code')}")

        return len(errors) == 0, errors

```

## Sprint 3 Enhancement

### 6. Statement Integration

- Add DDEX export capability to monthly statements
- Include ERN message generation for partner distribution
- Export usage data in DDEX Sales Report Message (SRM) format for PROs

## Implementation Priority

### P0 (Must have for DDEX compliance):

1. Enhanced metadata capture in upload flow
2. DDEX-compliant contributor roles
3. Technical metadata storage
4. UPC generation for releases

### P1 (Should have):

1. ERN 4.3 export functionality
2. DDEX validation service
3. Sales reporting message format

### P2 (Nice to have):

1. MEAD metadata for enhanced discovery
2. Full DDEX choreography implementation
3. Partner distribution API integration

## Testing Requirements

### E2E Tests to Add:

- **E2E-DDEX-01:** Upload with all DDEX metadata → successful validation → ERN export valid
- **E2E-DDEX-02:** Missing required DDEX fields → upload blocked with clear error
- **E2E-DDEX-03:** Generated ERN message passes DDEX schema validation

## Timeline Impact

- **Sprint 1:** +3 days for enhanced metadata capture
- **Sprint 2:** +5 days for DDEX export engine
- **Sprint 3:** +2 days for statement integration

**Total:** 10 additional development days across first 3 sprints to achieve DDEX compliance.
