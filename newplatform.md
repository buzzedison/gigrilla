Taming The Music Industry
While the Music Industry generates tens-of-billions every year, this money doesn’t mean musicians are getting rich. Too many talents aren’t paid fairly for their efforts.

There are too many middle-agents with fingers in the pie; too many unbalanced record deals that aren’t fit for the digital age; and there’s far too little being done about it.

Enough is enough. Gigrilla is here to promote Fair Trade Music, where the talent behind the music gets rewarded for their creativity and their time making music happen.

We can’t control existing contracts, or make bigger slices of the pie available to the people behind the music. But we can make sure we don’t take a cut from music money.

Gigrilla is different. We don’t take a cut. We want to make it easier to make music, not harder, and we want the talent behind the music we love to be paid fairly for making it.

100% of the money made by streaming and downloading music goes directly to the Rights Holders. That’s more money going directly to Artists and others owed royalties.

We also give Artists and Venues the ability to connect and book Gigs directly, so Fans enjoy more live music globally, while giving Artists the ability to keep more of their money.

Our mission? Taming the Music Industry with Fair Trade Music.

All we ask is that our members support our mission by subscribing to Gigrilla for £1.00/year. This supports the platform on which we are building a better future for the music industry.

Default Royalty Splits
Royalties are paid directly to Rights Holders. Now you can set the default Royalty Splits.
Ignore other Rights Holders here - this is purely for the Artist-share of Royalties, and how that is divided among Artist Members (and your Artist Support Team, if they get a share).

Think of Default Royalty Splits like this:
When you Gig, or release a Track, which members of your Artist team get paid, and what share?

ℹ️ Royalty Splits can be adjusted on an individual track level from your Control Panel later.
ℹ️ Individual Members will be paid their share of Royalties directly via Gigrilla.
ℹ️ All Royalties owed to the Artist’s members must add-up to 100%.
